jqPuzzle - Customizable Sliding Puzzles with jQuery
===================================================

This repository contains what will eventually be the next version of my jQuery plugin [jqPuzzle](http://www.2meter3.de/jqPuzzle/), a sliding puzzle based on jQuery.

Don't expect it to be ready anytime soon.

While the current plugin already supports an extensive set of configurable options, it lacks
- a modular approach with optional and pluggable components, e.g. renderers, input handlers, etc.
- an API that external components can talk to, excluding events and callbacks
- some features that makes it more useful for more use cases
- unit tests

I'd like to see this repository as a place to play around with all this. Let's see what happens. And when. :-)
